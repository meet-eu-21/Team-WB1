Topic B : Chromosome compartments

## Basic pipeline
You should first download the data from http://www.lcqb.upmc.fr/meetu/dataforstudent/  
Then preprocess HiC matrices and the file with epigenetic marks using ```preprocess_mtx.py``` and ```preprocess_epi.py```.
Finally you can run the analysis with ```calc_comps.py```.

Check out bash script ```run_analysis.sh``` that we used for obtaining the results shared on github.
